	<h1>Siyavula Education</h1>
	<h2>Technology-powered-learning</h2>

<p>We believe in:
<ul><li>openness in education:<br/>
When educators openly share their learning and teaching material such as lessons plans, notes, worksheets, presentations and exam questions with one another, everybody benefits from them.</li>
<li>communities of educators working together:<br/>
When educators collaborate to create and adapt teaching material, share best practices and support one another, they can achieve great things.</li>
<li>technology:<br/>
When technology is used appropriately, it can amplify individual contributions, make teachersâ€™ lives easier and provide a more engaging learning experience for learners.</li>
</ul></p>
